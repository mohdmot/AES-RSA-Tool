## Introduction
The GUI Tool for AES and RSA Encryption/Decryption is a user-friendly application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt data using the AES and RSA cryptographic algorithms. This markdown document provides a brief overview of the tool and instructions for downloading and running it.

## Download and Installation
To download and install the GUI Tool, follow these steps:

1. Download the `main.py` file, from this repo.
2. Save the `main.py` file to your desired location on your computer.

## Usage
To use the GUI Tool for AES and RSA Encryption/Decryption, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Run the `main.py` file.
3. Select the encryption or decryption algorithm (AES or RSA) from the provided options.
4. Choose encryption or decryption process.
5. Enter the message (encrypted or normal).
6. Enter key (if there).
7. Click Launch.
8. You will get the output in the text box (and the private/public keys if RSA).
